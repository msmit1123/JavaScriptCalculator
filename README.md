# Basic Javascript Calculator

A basic javascript calculator made with order or operations and parentheses grouping funcionality.

I made the calculator as a tool that I like and would use, improviing over a basic phone app. I treated the FreeCodeCamp.org "basic javascript calculator" project as the client needs.
